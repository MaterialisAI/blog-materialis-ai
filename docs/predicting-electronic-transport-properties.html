            Civilization continues to be powered largely by fossil fuels. Though renewable sources of energy, such as
        wind and solar, are increasingly becoming prevalent, the shift away from fossil fuels, which introduce an
        extraneous source of carbon into the environment, leading to unwanted effects, such as global warming and
        ocean acidification, has proven to be too slow to address environmental concerns. One means of reducing the
        usage of fossil fuels involves the recycling of waste heat back into a usable form, such as electricity.
        About 70% of our energy is wasted as unusable heat. By making more efficient use of a fuel, it becomes necessary
        to use less of it. Typically, converting waste heat into electricity involves the use of machines such as steam
        engines, but these devices are often made of multiple moving parts, which makes them difficult to scale to
        widespread usage, and are too cumbersome to be flexible enough for a variety of scenarios. An alternative is a
        solid state device known as a thermoelectric generator, built from thermoelectric materials.
