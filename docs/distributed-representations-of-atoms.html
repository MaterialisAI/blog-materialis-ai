            An important aspect of applying Machine Learning (ML) to a problem involves choosing a suitable
            representation for the objects under consideration. For example, to classify a flower that belongs to one of
            a number of different species, one might choose to represent the flower as a list of scalar and categorical
            features, such as petal length, petal width, and color. The ability of an ML model to properly perform a
            task depends strongly on the quality of the representation used. In fact, this is so important in
            determining the success of an ML project, that feature engineering is often the activity that receives the
            most attention.
        </p>

        <p>
            For many types of problems that ML is applied to, the advent of
            <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539" target="_blank">Deep Learning</a> changed things dramatically.
            Instead of requiring the manual engineering of features, Deep Learning is often capable of automatically
            building suitable representations from more basic, and often higher-dimensional representations of the
            objects under consideration. In Computer Vision and image processing, this basic representation typically
            consists of the pixels of the image. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), the basic representation is often
            a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot#Machine_learning_and_statistics" target="_blank">one-hot vector</a>
            (when the objects are individual words), or a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model" target="_blank">bag-of-words vector</a> (when the
            objects are sentences). In board games, such as Go or Chess, the representation can be layers of binary
            matrices that represent player and opponent pieces and their relative positions, amongst other elements of
            the game. In all of these examples, the basic representations are high-dimensional, and require very little
            effort from the ML practitioner to devise. Classic ML algorithms, such as the Support Vector Machine, or the
            Random Forest, would likely have problems learning with such high-dimensional representations. A Deep
            Learning model, on the other hand, is often able to automatically extract the representation best suited for
            the task at hand starting from such basic representations, since internal representations are learned
            end-to-end, by taking advantage of the error signal provided by backpropagation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The representations a Deep Learning model learns, however, may not be readily interpretable by a human. The
            kinds of representations learned by a Deep Learning model usually stand in contrast to a classical, manually
            constructed representation. Such manually curated feature vectors can be called <span class="emph">local
            representations</span>, since each of the elements in the list of features may have little to do with the
            other elements, and typically represents something concrete and intelligible to a human. Representations
            in which each of the elements are coupled in some way, and work together to represent the object under
            consideration, can be called <span class="emph">distributed representations</span>. A Deep Learning model
            usually learns distributed representations.

                Figure 1: Illustration of one-hot and distributed representations. In the diagram, there are <i>n</i>
                kinds of objects represented, and <i>d</i> is the adjustable number of dimensions of the distributed
                representation.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            But what do these distributed representations mean? How do they represent the object under consideration?
            Essentially, they convert the object they represent into a point in a multi- (usually lower-) dimensional
            space, in such a way that the relationship to other objects is preserved. This usually means that the
            Euclidean distance between two such objects/points reflects their similarity. These representations thus
            provide a more principled structure to the input data, and are usually lower-dimensional, which should allow
            an ML model to learn a task more quickly and effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is nothing terribly new in the world of ML. In fact, the power of distributed representations was
            perhaps initially demonstrated in the field of NLP. In NLP tasks, individual words are commonly represented
            by vectors. As mentioned above, these can be one-hot vectors, but they are often pre-trained distributed
            representations. Pre-training is a procedure that typically involves applying an unsupervised learning
            algorithm to a dataset. This has been one of the ways that distributed representations of objects, such as
            words, are created. Representations created this way can be re-used in downstream tasks. Using pre-trained
            representations has the effect of accelerating and even improving learning. One such unsupervised learning
            algorithm for developing pre-trained distributed representations of words is
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec" target="_blank">Word2vec</a>. The result of the algorithm
            is that a vector is assigned to each word in the vocabulary present in the dataset; each word is assigned a
            unique vector from a learned semantic space, extracted automatically from the structure of the data. And
            since the words inhabit a structured semantic space, they can be combined using logical operations (such
            as addition and subtraction) to produce new vectors which also inhabit the same space.
        </p>

        <p>
            How does the Word2vec algorithm work? Consider the adage <i>&quot;You shall know a word by the company
            it keeps.&quot;</i> (attributed to J. R. Firth). The algorithm takes this concept and formalizes it as a
            learning problem. Specifically, the objective is to produce a model that assigns maximal probability to a
            word when it occurs in the context of certain other words. In practice, this usually means the model must
            learn to predict the neighbouring words that most often appear with it. The idea is that a word gets its
            meaning from the context in which it is used. Consider the statement &quot;A person walks into a
            store&quot;. How probable is it that the word &quot;person&quot; appears in the context of the words
            &quot;walks&quot; and &quot;store&quot;? It's surely more probable than the word &quot;car&quot;
            appearing in that context, for example. As we'll see shortly, the model used to predict neighbouring words is a
            feed-forward network with a single hidden layer, and the initial parameter matrix that transforms the input
            into the hidden layer is where we'll find the distributed representations for each word.
        </p>

        <p>
            What does any of this have to do with atoms, or Materials Science, for that matter? Consider that ML and
            Deep Learning are playing increasingly prominent roles in Computational Materials Science. It's not
            surprising, since many of the tasks encountered in Computational Materials Science involve the prediction
            of the properties of a material. The number of datasets related to materials properties is also increasing.
            It therefore seems natural that the advances made in ML should find application in Computational Materials
            Science. As such, a natural question to ask is: how are materials represented in the context of an ML task?
            The approaches being used are rapidly changing, but traditionally, materials and atoms are represented using
            local representations.
