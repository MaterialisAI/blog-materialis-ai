            The fields of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) continue to advance at a rapid pace.
            As their capabilities grow, their reach grows as well. Historically, the problems addressed by AI were
            generally academic in nature, and involved, for example, solving a puzzle, or navigating through a maze.
            Early examples of practical applications of ML include the recognition of hand-written characters. But as of
            today, in 2022, it is difficult to find an activity or problem of human interest that has not been touched
            by these technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
            One area very worthy of attention is materials science and chemistry. The proliferation of human
            civilization is intimately tied to the development of technology, and technology is enabled by our mastery
            of materials. The world currently faces environmental challenges, and civilization demands technological
            solutions. At the core of any such solution will surely be a material. Our ability to persist in the
            universe will increasingly depend on our ability to be masters of matter.
        </p>

        <p>
            What gives a material its properties? There are perhaps less than 80 types of atoms that we generally
            encounter, and far fewer are encountered regularly. We could take a collection of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen,
            Hydrogen, and Phosphorus atoms and arrange them into an inert solid slab, or we could arrange them
            into DNA. Clearly, a material's properties are determined by the arrangement of the atoms of which it is
            comprised. However, it isn't currently obvious how to assemble a collection of atoms into any shape one
            desires. Thus, the development of fabrication techniques at the nanoscale is required. Today,
            manufacturing is largely conducted top-down. One starts with a large aggregation of matter, and chips away
            until the desired shape is obtained. From an atomic perspective, such an approach is coarse and crude. With
            the exception of certain classes of substances, such as small organic molecules, our materials are generally
            not built to atomic specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mastering nanoscale manufacturing will be key in enabling the development of future technologies. We believe
            that ML and AI techniques will aid in achieving this goal. But even after we have advanced our ability to
            build with atomic precision, we are still faced with the question of <i>what</i> to build. What arrangement
            of atoms is required for a given task? There are countless ways that different atoms can be arranged in 3D
            space, and, as we stated above, it is the arrangement of atoms that determines a material's properties. Can
            ML and AI help us to choose which arrangements are best? We believe so.
        </p>

        <p>
            AI and ML technologies can enhance our ability to work at the nanoscale. The application of these
            technologies to the nano world is only in its infancy, but it is certainly an exciting and worthy endeavor.
